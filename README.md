# Jishen Harilal <sup><sub><sub> Software Engineering Student

Hi, I'm Jishen from South Africa, a student at [Varisty College](https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/campuses/durban-north) in Durban North, currently in my final year of working towards a degree in [Computer and Information Sciences in Application Development](https://www.varsitycollege.co.za/information-technology/full-time/bachelor-of-computer-and-information-sciences-in-application-development). I deal primarily with engineering software solutions in multiple languages, frameworks, and platforms.
